# Warehouse INC

An online clicker game worked on by a bunch of my friends in a discord server.

# Hosts

Your best bet for being up-to-date at nearly all times is https://minidogg.github.io/warehouse-inc/ however it takes a bit to deploy new updates but, doesn't have an update limit per-day like vercel.

Primary Dev Host: Will be up by the weekend hopefully (March 27 2024).

Primary Host: I'm gonna talk to wacky about getting a feds.contact subdomain for this with an auto-updating server.

Primary Vercel Host: https://warehouse-inc.vercel.app/

Broken And May Never Work Host: https://national-uncommon-grouper.ngrok-free.app/warehouse-inc/

If for whatever reason vercel isn't deploying try the github pages site: https://minidogg.github.io/warehouse-inc/
